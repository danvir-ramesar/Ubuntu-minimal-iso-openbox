###   Method that was used: 


can get minimal iso from:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD

### iso was burnt to usb and used as an installation medium

### Prompts was followed until option to select desktop environments was presented. Here,  NOTHING was selected and continued with install.

### When install was done, system was rebooted (virtual machine or computer or laptop) and instsallation usb with iso was removed.

### loged in by typing in  username, then password

### First and most imoprtant: 

sudo apt update  ### to update the system 

## Then

sudo apt install xorg    ### x11 server to allow for a graphic environment

sudo apt install openbox obconf obmenu     ### install openbox, its configureation files and its menu

sudo apt install lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter firefox nano leafpad xterm terminator nitrogen gnome-software ark pcmanfm  ### these are some useful apps to get things going. It has the lightdm login manager, a terminal emulator and a back up just incase, nano to edit files in terminal, nitrogen for wallpapers, gnome-software for a software center, ark for a manager, pcmanfm as a graphical file explorer

### reboot and see if you can login to openbox. you should have to fill in your password via the lightdm gtk greeter.


### install of obmenu generator. this allows for icons in openbox menu and eliminates apps from being in the menu if they are not already installed.

### to do this the ffg comands was used:

sudo apt install make git cpanminus libgtk2-perl

git clone git://github.com/trizen/obmenu-generator
    
sudo cp obmenu-generator/obmenu-generator /usr/bin
    
sudo cp -r obmenu-generator/schema.pl ~/.config/obmenu-generator
    
sudo cpanm Linux::DesktopFiles
    
sudo cpanm Data::Dump
    
sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/obmenu-generator

obmenu-generator -p -i
